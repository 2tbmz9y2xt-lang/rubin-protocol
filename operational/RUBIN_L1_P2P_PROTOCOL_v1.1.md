# RUBIN L1 P2P Protocol v1.1 — Location Note (Operational)

This file is intentionally a pointer.

Authoritative P2P wire protocol for RUBIN v1.1 lives under:

- `spec/RUBIN_L1_P2P_PROTOCOL_v1.1.md`

Rationale:

- The P2P protocol is referenced by CANONICAL §15 and is part of the spec surface (auxiliary, non-consensus).
- The `operational/` directory is reserved for operator policy/runbooks and non-normative operational guidance.
