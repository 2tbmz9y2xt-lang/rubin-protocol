version: '1.1'
profile: RUBIN_L1_CANONICAL_v1.1
status: PASS
updated: '2026-02-18'
execution_note: All 17 gates PASS. Phase 0 DoD closed (CV-PARSE/CV-SIGHASH/CV-BIND/CV-UTXO/CV-DEP/CV-BLOCK/CV-REORG PASS with cross-client parity in standalone runners).
  CV-ANCHOR-RELAY is policy-only (non-consensus, required:false) — 11 vectors covering relay caps and T-016 separation lemma.
