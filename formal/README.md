# formal/

This directory is reserved for formal-methods artifacts for RUBIN L1/L0 (models, proofs, and machine-checkable invariants).

Status: placeholder (pre-freeze). Do not rely on the contents yet.

Controller decision:
- Approved 2026-02-16: `formal/` may remain a placeholder until production freeze.

Production-freeze expectation:
- Before production freeze, `formal/` MUST contain either (a) real artifacts (models/proofs), or (b) an explicit pointer to the authoritative formal repository plus a stable revision identifier.
