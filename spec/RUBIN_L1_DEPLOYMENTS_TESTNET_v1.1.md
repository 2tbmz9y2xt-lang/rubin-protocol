# RUBIN L1 VERSION_BITS Deployments: TESTNET v1.1

Status: DRAFT (NON-CONSENSUS)  
Date: 2026-02-16

This file publishes the testnet deployment registry using the normative schema in:

- `spec/RUBIN_L1_CANONICAL_v1.1.md §8.1`

It does not change the canonical consensus rules. It fixes the chain-instance deployment schedule so all clients and operators share the same interpretation of deployment state on testnet.

## Deployment Table (v1.1)

No consensus deployments are defined for testnet under v1.1 at this time.
state: none
